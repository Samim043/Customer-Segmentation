Customer-Segmentation
========================


Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. With the help of clustering techniques, **B2C** (Business to customers) companies can identify the several segments of customers that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.This will allow them to target the potential user base. 

\- In this Data Science Project, we will perform one of the most essential applications of machine learning â€“ Customer Segmentation. In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in python. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology.


**1. Exploratory data analysis**
-------------------------------
We will start our customer segmentation project by exploring the data. Our data consists of one .csv file containing the following features that describe each customer:
* CustomerIDs. 
* Age.
* Gender.
* Annual Income.
* Spending Score.

Dataset is ### mall_customer.csv
